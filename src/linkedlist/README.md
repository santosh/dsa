# Linked List

What problems does Linked List fix?

1. Array has fixed length.
2. Array con have fragmented memory chunks.

With LL, you don't need to declare length of the data structure. And the linked list length can be changed at runtime.
No need to allocate contagious memory. The new node can be anywhere in the memory.

Linked List is a collection of List nodes.
